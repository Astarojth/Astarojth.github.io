Research Interests
======
My research interests are mainly in AI ethic and AIGC, iucluding text-to-image models, multi-modal models, trustworthy AI, and application of LLMs. My research interest is driven by a vision of building a future where humans and AI coexist harmoniously. I am particularly interested in generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and multi-modal models, exploring their potential application while ensuring they are developed responsibly and ethically. By integrating text, images, and speech, I aim to enhance AIâ€™s capabilities, contributing to a future where AI systems are trustworthy, transparent, and beneficial, ultimately fostering a more equitable and positive human-AI coexistence.
